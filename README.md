# Assignment 1 : City Website

The content of this website is all about the city of Columbus, Ohio, my hometown! I was born and grew up there, so this was the perfect opportunity to demonstrate what makes it so wonderful.

The website built contains pages for each of the topics about the city of Columbus, OH. Pages include History, Geography, Economy, Demographics, and Arts & Culture. 

The interface designed is centered around the navigation sidebar. The fixed sidebar is the primary navigation method. Links included will send you to the appropriate page.

            Columbus hosts two major league professional sports teams: the
            Columbus Blue Jackets of the National Hockey League (NHL) which play
            at Nationwide Arena and Columbus Crew SC of Major League Soccer
            (MLS) which play at Mapfre Stadium, the first soccer-specific
            stadium built in the United States for a Major League Soccer team.
            The Crew were one of the original members of MLS and won their first
            MLS Cup in 2008, with a second title in 2020. The Columbus Crew is
            scheduled to move into a new downtown stadium in the summer of 2021,
            which will also feature a mixed-use development site named
            Confluence Village.

            The Columbus Clippers, a Triple A
            International League affiliate of the Cleveland Indians (formerly a
            long-time affiliate of the New York Yankees through 2006, and the
            Washington Nationals through 2008), play in Huntington Park, which
            opened in 2009. The city was home to the Panhandles/Tigers football
            team from 1901 to 1926; they are credited with playing in the first
            NFL game against another NFL opponent. In the late 1990s, the
            Columbus Quest won the only two championships during American
            Basketball League's two-and-a-half season existence.
